## App Description:
The Web app's main idea is to make it easier for a pet owner to monitor his pet/s regardless of where the owner is. The only requirement for the owner is to have a computer, WIFI, and a camera installed in a room at home, which is where the pet would be. The solution is an online web application that the owner has access to, in order to watch his pet through a camera installed at home. This will provide a real-time streamed video feed from the camera. The owner then will be able to watch his pet whenever he wants and on the spot.

Monitoring the pet will help the owner to keep track of what the pet is doing at that exact moment. This will enable him to act swiftly in case of an emergency. To further elaborate, if the owner sports any abnormal activity he can act accordingly. Moreover, it will give him the freedom to perform his daily commutes in a less stressful environment. By knowing that he can check up on his pet at any time.

The owner will be able to connect to the installed camera at home after accessing the network. This will be done by opening his browser and accessing the web application. He then has to log-in to his account which will have access to the camera at his home. This is to ensure security because he would be the only one who can access the camera. Then, a live video feed from the camera will be sent to his browser and hence he would be able to observe his pet. The web application makes use of WebRTC technology.
